GRTS Flow:
	Select Master Sample
		Chooses exactly one master sample to pull a subset of sites from
	
	Define Frame
		Filters the sites from the master sample to a manageable number (> 80000)
		Stores the resulting sites in the Frame of this design

	Select Other Sites
		Selects one or more user samples that work with the master sample (based on weight/attributes)
		Stores the resulting sites in the Frame
		If you're doing Panels, you need to have an attribute in your user sample that is marked as a panel variable, and has values that match the panels in your create panels step below

	Create Panels
		Creates the schedule you'll visit the sites
		If you're not doing Stratify then you allocate the number of sites per panel here
		If you're not doing Panels then a panel titled 'Default' is created for you, since GRTS requires panels.

	Compute Attributes
		Creates attributes for stratification with javascript functions

	Stratify
		Creates Strata based on attributes (computed or not) and assigns the sites to that particular strata

	Generate Sites
		Queues and Runs the R GRTS code


		R Code: (For each sample design)
			Mark design as started in grts flow
			Get list of MS sites
			Validate list is OK (shape, num sites)
			Determine target panel size
			Get list of Legacy sites

			Call strat_panel.fcn from grts R code
				Validate target panel size
				Set up strata (None, or what was done previously)
				Validate no strata are empty
				Validate ms sites have correct attributes (site id, x coord, y coord) and resolve duplicates
				If not using legacy sites call: ms.panel.fcn
					Notes:
					# trgt.psz is the vector of target panel sizes (or target sample size if only
					#   one panel)
					# prob.nam is the column in ms.df that contains relative inclusion
					#   probabilities for the frame.  Default assumes equi-probable sample.
					# returned value is a list with two components
					# message  is any error or informative message
					# result is data frame with the first three rows as follows:
					#  result[,1] =  panel number
					#  result[,2] = over sample indicator (0 = no, 1 = yes site is over sample site
					#  result[,3] = adjusted weight based on panel size
					# The remaining columns of reslt are copied from ms.df



				If using legacy sites:
					Validate legacy sites have correct attributes
					For each strata:
						Pull out legacy sites + ms sites that belong to strata
						Pass into ms.legacy.panel.fcn

							#
							# ms.df contains the sample downloaded from the Master Sample website.
							#   Legacy sample points must be supplied in the data frame legacy.df.
							#   
							#
							# legacy.df is the data frame of legacy points.  User must define strata 
							#   (if any) and panel assignments (if panels are required). These must be in 
							#   the same projection and units as used by the Master Sample.  Columns must 
							#   include site.id","x.coord","y.coord"  consistent with ms.df.  If strata or 
							#   panels are required, stratum column should have the same name as the ms.df 
							#   stratum column, panel column should be names "Panel".  
							#   The legacy points are assumed to be located on the stream network sampled 
							#     the Master Sample.  They should have been selected using the same GIS
							#     coverage as the MS.  
							#
							#
							# trgt.psz is the vector of target panel sizes (or target sample size if only
							#   one panel)
							#
							# prob.name is name of column in ms.df) that contains relative inclusion
							#   probabilities for the frame.  Default assumes equi-probable sample.
							#   If prob.name is set, prob.name must also be in legacy.df.  For
							#   example, to select a sample with inclusion probability proportional to
							#   stream order, both prob.name  should be set name of column with stream order
							#   of the respective points
							#
							#
							# Points with coordinates in legacy.df are included wp1.  Nearby points (in
							#   hierarchical order ) have prob adjusted downward to compensate.
							#
							# Sample will be returned in reverse hierarchical order unless "leg.first"
							#   is set to TRUE.  If leg.first is TRUE, legacy points will appear before new
							#   points.

							Validate weight col
							count MS sites
							count legacy sites
							calculate total sites
							populate panel field on legacy dataframe with 1's
							get legacy sites per panel
							split MS points into num panel segments w/size proportional to target panel size
							get total points per panel
							Validate counts of sites are valid (total sites per panel < target panel size)
							Validate that target panel size < number of legacy sites for this panel
							Calculate Oversample by rounding target panel size up the next power of 2 (size: 36 -> 64)
								Unless the result is less than 1.5x the target panel size, then use the next power of 2?
							Calculate the Reverse Hierarchical Order of the MS sites for this strata
							# assign panels & over sample
							For each Panel:
								Get counts of MS sites for panel
								Get counts of legacy sites for panel
								get total pop for panel
								Get probability from column or compute it

								# get HR order for composite of legacy & MS points
								# Scale to unit square & get random offset
								# partition so no more than 1 sample point per cell & construct hierarchical
   								# address for all points 
   								# Non-randomized addresses of points are in matrix nhadr
								# pick points in panel 
								# pick sample from points in panel
								# construct  reverse hierarchical order for over-sample points
								# Place weighted points on line in reverse hierarchical order


								construct output data frame for panel/strat from rho above
								accumulate panel data in result
							return data for all panels in this strata
						accumulate data in strata list to be returned
				return full list sites
			Parse output and messages from strat_panel.fcn
			Validate output is valid (has sites)
			Save the list of sites back to MR database
			Mark sample design as grts flow has ended.
